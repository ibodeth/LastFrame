## 🧠 AI Video Use Cases

Designed for:

* **Video continuation** (Runway, Pika, Luma, SVD)
* **Frame-to-frame consistency**
* **Image-to-video / video-to-video** pipelines

Typical flow:

1. Generate a video
2. Extract last frame with LastFrameDropper
3. Feed that frame back into the AI model as input

This reduces visual jumps and keeps camera, lighting, and composition consistent.
